# StratusLink-Communications-Ad-Campaign-Efficiency-and-Strategy
Analyzed 3,453 rows of campaign data for a telecommunications client, creating pivot tables and Tableau dashboards to evaluate performance across Spatial, Audience, Creative, and Inventory dimensions. Delivered actionable insights that optimized ad prioritization and improved campaign ROI.


As part of my Co-op Careers fellowship, I worked on the Creative Analyst team for a telecommunications client, analyzing media campaign performance across multiple channels. My focus was on ad creative performance, where I calculated KPIs based on ad size, format, devices, and creative messaging. I processed and cleaned thousands of rows of raw Excel data, used pivot tables to aggregate metrics, and created interactive Tableau dashboards with custom calculated fields to uncover insights for ad sizes.

These insights informed which creative units were most cost-efficient, helping the client optimize ad prioritization and improve overall campaign ROI. This project strengthened my skills in data analysis, Excel, Tableau, and actionable marketing insights, while contributing directly to media strategy recommendations.
